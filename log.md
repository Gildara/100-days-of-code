# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0:July 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**:Will be starting my 100 days on Monday, July 17, 2017.

**Thoughts:**I've hesitated to start this challenge because I believe it is good to take a day off once a week to give my subconscious time to process things.  But it seems like such a great idea I decided to give it a try.


### Day 1: July 17, 2017
