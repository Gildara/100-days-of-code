# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0:July 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**:Will be starting my 100 days on Monday, July 17, 2017.

**Thoughts:**I've hesitated to start this challenge because I believe it is good to take a day off once a week to give my subconscious time to process things.  But it seems like such a great idea I decided to give it a try.


### Day 1: July 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked some more on caesar's Cipher in C.  Finally got argv[1] to cast as an integer.

**Thoughts:**This is much harder than it was in javascript.  I thought the prof said in the lecture(edx cs50 week 2) that you could cast a string as a number just by putting it into a mathematical expression, but I couldn't get it to work. Maybe argv[] is a special case. I ended up c&ping some code I don't completely understand to force argv[n] to be a number.  The code used pointers which haven't even been mentioned yet in class so I suspect I did not do this in the way they wanted.
