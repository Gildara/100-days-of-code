# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0:July 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Will be starting my 100 days on Monday, July 17, 2017.

**Thoughts**: I've hesitated to start this challenge because I believe it is good to take a day off once a week to give my subconscious time to process things.  But it seems like such a great idea I decided to give it a try.


### Day 1: July 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked some more on caesar's Cipher in C.  Finally got argv[1] to cast as an integer.

**Thoughts**:This is much harder than it was in javascript.  I thought the prof said in the lecture(edx cs50 week 2) that you could cast a string as a number just by putting it into a mathematical expression, but I couldn't get it to work. Maybe argv[] is a special case. I ended up c&ping some code I don't completely understand to force argv[n] to be a number.  The code used pointers which haven't even been mentioned yet in class so I suspect I did not do this in the way they wanted.

### Day 2: July 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Trying to get a copy of my project on my local machine.  Works fine on codepen, doesn't work from local copy.

**Thoughts**: Most of my time seems to be spent trying to understand tools. Frustrating day.


### Day 3: July 19, 2017

**Today's Progress** Another long, frustrating day, but I did figure out how to process scss files.  

**Thoughts**: I want to install the compass gem, but for some reason I can't find my ruby dir.  Doubly frustrating because I installed the sass preprossessor gem without any problem, so obviously ruby is installed somewhere, lol.


### Day 4: July 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went back to working on Caesar's Cypher in C  

**Thoughts**: I got it to work using pointers, but I really don't think that is how I should be doing it, so tomorrow I will try to get it working sans pointers.


### Day 5: July 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Struggled with trying to get my Caesar's Cipher to work without using pointers.

**Thoughts**: What's happening is kinda weird. Sometimes it gives me values and sometimes it gives me addresses. I think?...



### Day 6: July 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started 30 days of code challenge and did the first challenge in c and in javascript. Went back over part of the second week lecture from cs50 to see if there is anything that might help me solve Caesar's Cipher without using pointers.

**Thoughts**: Saturday has always been my day off, or as much of a day off as I could make it, so I am going to watch vids and read up on things on my Saturdays, or other relatively easy tasks.


### Day 7: July 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Second day of 30 days of code and I can't figure out how to concat strings in C. But i did solve the rest of the problem.

**Thoughts**: I may decide to drop 30days because the tutorial is for Java and I am trying to do the problems in C. Also I feel like my attention is spread too far with freecodecamp cs50 and 30days.


### Day 8: July 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally!! got the main part of Caesar's Cipher for cs 50 to work.

**Thoughts**: That rush of seeing something work after being stuck for days is some powerful intermittant reinforcer.


### Day 9: July 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did all the little stuff for the Caesar's Cipher problem and rechecked the specification to make sure it was all just so.

**Thoughts**: I'm really learning a lot, but everything takes me so so long. Still every success builds my confidence a bit.


### Day 10: July 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the next exercise for cs50. It's another cypher called Vigenère’s. Worked through something called a segmentation fault.  Struggled with it for quite a while before noticing a flaw in my logic which was easily fixed. 

**Thoughts**: Progress, but so slow. I should probably drop some of my other interests and just concentrate on this one, except I can't stay focused on just one thing for a long time.


### Day 11: July 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on cipher problem for cs50.

**Thoughts**: I just noticed that freecodecamp now has their own version of an introductory programming class.  I've been feeling that my progress is so slow because I am dividing my attention. I am really enjoying the cs50 problems, but I am going to try to concentrate on freecodecamp.


### Day 12: July 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Looked at the next problem for freecodecamp, Search amd Replace. Ended up with a partial solution, but there is some kind of flaw.

**Thoughts**: On first looking at this problemI was clueless, but then it started to come together. I think I should approach programming they way I approach writing. Given a prompt or subject I have no idea what to write, but I trust that my subconscious will come up with something adequate.


### Day 13: July 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved search and replace as soon as I glanced over yesterday's code. It was just that I forgot () after the function, lol. Started Pig Latin challenge. After much struggle and reading, conquered regexp.

**Thoughts**: I feel like an imposter. Yes, I seem to be doing better with the challenges, but I still suck so bad at design. The problem isn't that I suck at design, though. The problem is that I have no map for improvement and so I am just avoiding my wikireader.  


### Day 14: July 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working on fcc pig latin challenge.  Got it to work correctly if the word starts with a vowel or one consonant. Tried without success to get it to work if word starts with more than one consonant.

**Thoughts**: Perhaps tomorrow I will try just coding in constant values for words that start with 2 consonants and then, if necessary, 3 in order to detect the underlying pattern I need.


### Day 15: July 31, 2017

**Today's Progress** :I think I am on the cusp of understanding how to make pig Latin challenge work for all cases.

**Thoughts**: I have too many ifs and fors and so on. It's confusing and ugly.  Maybe this is why we have functional programming? Right now I just want to get it working; erhaps then I will go back over functional programming and see if it looks useful. I'm going to start adding 'Plan' to the next day's log when I finish coding. That way I will know exactly where to start.



### Day 16: August 1, 2017

**Plan**: Try to finish pig latin challenge. If time I can start looking at the CSS3 extension gradients section.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the pig Latin challenge. Started looking at chrome css3 gradient extension.  Codepen doesn't like it at all.

**Thoughts**: I don't know if I am getting better at this, or if I have just been hitting a different kind of problem, but this seems easier.  I mean, it still takes me extremely long, but I am not sitting stumped for days.


### Day 17: August 2, 2017

**Plan**: Try to figure out how to do these css3 gradients. If that starts getting too stressful, I can check out the next freecodecamp problem.

**Today's Progress**: Cut and pasted some examples of gradients and then played around with them to try to figure out how they work. 

**Thoughts**: Two hours of experimenting with the code and I still don't really get it. I should probably just abandon the idea of a gradient background. It seems so easy and straight forward, but then it doesn't WAE.


### Day 18: August 3, 2017

**Plan**: Try again to figure out linear gradients.

**Today's Progress**: Finally got the linear gradient to work the way I want.  

**Thoughts**:  I read the directions, do exactly what it says and then it doesn't work.  Then I start changing stuff and fooling around and after a while it usually starts working, but I don't really understand what I am doing.


### Day 19: August 4, 2017

**Plan**: Look around codepen to see how other people deal with having hardly any content. I may look at gradients some more, as sometimes after a break new ideas surface. I also have the option of letting this go and working on the next fcc problem. 

**Today's Progress**: Got a feel for how to deal with limited content on a page by looking through a bunch of codepen projects. Followed a tutorial to make a cool search box for wikipedia viewer project.

**Thoughts**: I'm unhappy with the (lack of) responsiveness of the page. 


### Day 20: August 5, 2017

**Plan**: Saturday is normally my day off, which I use to regroup and give my subconscience a chance to catch up so I am going to try to find something that isn't really hard to do.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on making the wiki viewer responsive. Also spent a good bit of time experimenting with box shadows. 

**Thoughts**: I didn't really make progress on the wiki viewer today, but I feel like I learned a lot, and I have an idea what to try next.


### Day 21: August 6, 2017

**Plan**: Back to bootstrap to refresh my memory and then I can try to apply it to the wiki viewer.

**Today's Progress**: Went back to refresh my memory of bootstrap and then set up some bootstrap columns and adjusted the css for search box and button.

**Thoughts**:  Why does it take so long to fiddle with css? It's like I am never satisfied. Also, I feel like I am not doing this right.


### Day 22: August 7, 2017

**Plan**: More css fussing and work on responsiveness.

**Today's Progress**: Finally got the search box and submit button to look the way I want.

**Thoughts**: I find arranging elements on the page sooooo confusing. I thought bootstrap was supposed to help with that, but sometimes it just doesn't work the way I think it should. WHY is this so hard? I feel like that android Spock and company (OS) drove insane: "ILLOGICAL ILLOGICAL"


### Day 23: August 8, 2017

**Plan**: Continue struggling with the positioning of elements on the page.

**Today's Progress**: Got all the content on the page for the wikipedia viewer and styled it.

**Thoughts**: Just one thing is not responsive. Why? I don't know.


### Day 24: August 9, 2017

**Plan**: Work on responsiveness.

**Today's Progress**: er, now it's worse?

**Thoughts**: I need to learn to save my work before messing with it, because sometimes I forget to do that, and oh what a mess that makes.


### Day 25: August 10, 2017

**Plan**: Try to get things back the way they were by starting a new file and adding the code in a bit at a time so I can find what is causing the problem.

**Today's Progress**: Learned about flex-box and w3-css framework.

**Thoughts**: Neither flex-box nor w3-css would center the form.  Why is centering so hard? Did my coding late in the afternoon and I can see that is not a good time for me to be trying to figure things out.


### Day 26: August 11, 2017

**Plan**: Try flex-box again in case I was just too tired to make it work yesterday.

**Today's Progress**: Nixed flexbox.  Got everything responsive across Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

**Thoughts**: It looks ok, but not exactly as I wanted.  Going to move on because perfect is the enemy of the good. 


### Day 27: August 12, 2017

**Plan**: Not sure what I am going to work on. If I don't think of anything else, I can always start transferring everything to codepen.
That should be good for several aggravating days.

**Today's Progress**:Tried to figure out why my weather api is no longer working. Started trying to figure out how to use wikipedia api.

**Thoughts**: Wow wikipedia api is hard to understand. I think I finally (sort of) get it.  Noticed my random quote machine and local weather pens were messed up.  Fixed the quote machine but can't get the weather api to work. WTF? Transferred the wiki code I have so far to codepen last night with surprisingly little difficulty.


### Day 28: August 13, 2017

**Plan**: Either try to get weather project working again or start constructing code to pull search results from wikipedia. Or both.

**Today's Progress**: Found the problems with the weather app and fixed them.  Wrote down a bunch of notes on jQuery and ajax requests that seem useful for the wikipedia viewer. 

**Thoughts**: I'm still puzzled as to why my weather app stopped working.  Someone suggested I might need a new appi key, but changing that didn't seem to do anything. Anyway I fixed it.


### Day 29: August 14, 2017

**Plan**: Start making Wiki Viewer work.  Get the call to the api worked out.

**Today's Progress**: Got the ajax call to the wikiapp working. Ran into another problem with element positioning. 

**Thoughts**: I feel like I am learning a lot.  I'm almost always going way over my hour minimum because I get absorbed in the work.
 <3 <3 <3 flow
 
 
 ### Day 30: August 15, 2017
 
 **Plan**: See if I can apply the code from the first form to make the 2nd form look the way I originally wanted it.
 
 **Today's Progress**: Struggled with stupid form and its css.  Very little progress made.
 
 **Thoughts**: Did my coding in the evening so I could participate in an online coding group. The group was very nice but I do better if I work in the morning. 
 


  ### Day 31: August 16, 2017
 
  **Plan**: Attack form with renewed vigor.
   
  **Today's Progress**: I have got to stop fiddling with the css for wikipedia viewer or I will die of old age before I finish it. Wasted my day fiddling. MUST STOP.
   
  **Thoughts**:  I was super tempted to skip today because I was all stressed out trying to deal with bureaucracy, but I pushed through. I don't know why I am being so picky about the css. It's not like the javascript code I write isn't baby code, so why should I have learned css thoroughly already? I need to move on.
  
  
 ### Day 32: August 17, 2017
    
  **Plan**:  I will work on functionality. Absolutely no fussing with css. Really.
    
  **Today's Progress**: Worked on functionality for wikipedia viewer. Added instructions on empty search with jQuery. I still have to get the json data onto my page and I am not sure how to do that. But the first button does call the data correctly.
     
  **Thoughts**: Definitely best to work in the morning. I'm smarter and my frustration tolerance is higher. Really enjoying this project.
  
  
 ### Day 33: August 18, 2017
    
 **Plan**: Continue work on random button. Reconsider calling url with js if necessary.
  
 **Today's Progress**: Got distracted by codeschool's free weekend. Checked out several tracks.
   
 **Thoughts**: I seem to be procrastinating.
   
   
  ### Day 34: August 19, 2017
  
 **Plan**: I'm going to allow another day of codeschool so I can check out their sass and flexbox courses, as well as the regular javascript track. Also need to transfer all the new code to codepen so I can post a link to it here.
   
**Today's Progress**:  Worked on Sass and flexbox on code school.

 **Thoughts**: Codeschool is pretty cool, but I think I need to put most of my time into projects.
 
 
 ### Day 35: August 20, 2017
 
 **Plan**: Continue with codeschool courses as this is the last day it is free.
 
 **Today's Progress**: More flexbox and Sass. 
 
  **Thoughts**: I need to get serious and go back to freecodecamp.
  
  
   ### Day 36: August 21, 2017
   
   **Plan**: Back to Wikipedia viewer.
   
   **Today's Progress**: Worked on wikipedia reader. Read about closures.
    
   **Thoughts**: I'm much happier when I am working on fcc stuff, because I truly belief it is the best way to learn. 
   
   
  ### Day 37: August 22, 2017
    
  **Plan**: Work on displaying data from wikipedia. Also can spend some time looking into dot net, but only after some decent work on fcc project.
  
  **Today's Progress**: Sidetracked by wordpress. Ugh. Looked into dot net and C# and felt tired.
  
  **Thoughts**: My energy is too scattered. Not sleeping well. Can't concentrate.  Just want to sleep.
  
  
    ### Day 38: August 23, 2017
    
  **Plan**: Same as yesterday since I didn't get to it: Work on displaying data from wikipedia. 
  
   **Today's Progress**: Got the search working on wikipedia viewer!
   
    **Thoughts**: Working on fcc stuff is more fun the more I learn. I still have a few things I want to do with wiki viewer but the functionality is done.
    
    **Link to project**: https://codepen.io/Gildara/pen/NgXjvo
    
     
  ### Day 39: August 24, 2017
  
 **Plan**: Work on making the rectangles invisible until button is clicked and/or a read more link for each article.
 
  **Today's Progress**:  Very engrossed in project today. Tried many ways to make hidden content visible on click. No success yet.
    
  **Thoughts**: NEED TO SAVE WORK BEFORE I START CHANGING THINGS.  I may be looking for a direct and easy solution when there isn't one.
    Have to sleep on it.
    
 
 ### Day 40: August 25, 2017
   
  **Plan**: Continue trying to make the rectangles do what I want them to do.
  
 **Today's Progress**: Tried a bunch more things but none of them worked.  I have an idea how to simplify the problem though, which I will try tomorrow.
 
**Thoughts**:  NEED TO SAVE WORK BEFORE I START CHANGING THINGS. This project is challenging and frustrating for me  and I really like it.  I have rarely challenged myself in life. Heh, maybe I should be honest and change that rarely to never.


 ### Day 41: August 26, 2017
 
 **Plan**: Make a fresh copy of the project and strip down the page to simplify it so I can figure out what the problem is.
 
 **Today's Progress**: Fixed the problem with the rectangles not displaying the way I wanted them to.
 
 **Thoughts**: Had this weird dream where js/css was floating past me and woke up with a vague sense that I knew how to solve my problem.  Thank you subconscience! What would I do without you?
 
 **Link to Project** https://codepen.io/Gildara/pen/NgXjvo 
 
 
  ### Day 42: August 27, 2017
  
   **Plan**:  Start figuring out read more link.
   
   **Today's Progress**: Worked on read more link for a long time.
   
    **Thoughts**: Very engrossed again. Went way past the hour.  Wish I had more time/energy.
    
    
 ### Day 43: August 28, 2017
    
 **Plan**:  Continue figuring out read more link. Don't forget to add social media links.
 
 **Today's Progress**: Got the read more links where I want them and wae.
 
 **Thoughts**: I got so deeply into a flow state that I forgot to eat and my food got cold.
 
 **Link to Project** https://codepen.io/Gildara/pen/NgXjvo 
 
 
 
 ### Day 44: August 29, 2017
 
 **Plan**:  Try to figure out why entering search terms works correctly but entering nonsense or nothing into search only works once.  Something to do with returns?  Also don't forget about social media links.
 
 **Today's Progress**: Tried many things. Still thinking. Will sleep on it.
 
 **Thoughts**: Decided to forget about social media links. I can do that when I make my portfolio.  I noticed that for wikipedia viewer although the ifs catch the nonsense or enmpty text field and display the right message(once) they never change the rects to display:none. That's odd.
  
  
  
 ### Day 45: August 30, 2017
 
  **Plan**: Keep sudying on why entering search terms works correctly but entering nonsense or nothing into search only works once and why the ifs catch the nonsense or enpty text field and display the right message(once) but never change the rects to display:none
  
  
 **Today's Progress**: 
  
  **Thoughts**:
