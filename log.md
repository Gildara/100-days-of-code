# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0:July 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Will be starting my 100 days on Monday, July 17, 2017.

**Thoughts**: I've hesitated to start this challenge because I believe it is good to take a day off once a week to give my subconscious time to process things.  But it seems like such a great idea I decided to give it a try.


### Day 1: July 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked some more on caesar's Cipher in C.  Finally got argv[1] to cast as an integer.

**Thoughts**:This is much harder than it was in javascript.  I thought the prof said in the lecture(edx cs50 week 2) that you could cast a string as a number just by putting it into a mathematical expression, but I couldn't get it to work. Maybe argv[] is a special case. I ended up c&ping some code I don't completely understand to force argv[n] to be a number.  The code used pointers which haven't even been mentioned yet in class so I suspect I did not do this in the way they wanted.

### Day 2: July 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Trying to get a copy of my project on my local machine.  Works fine on codepen, doesn't work from local copy.

**Thoughts**: Most of my time seems to be spent trying to understand tools. Frustrating day.


### Day 3: July 19, 2017

**Today's Progress** Another long, frustrating day, but I did figure out how to process scss files.  

**Thoughts**: I want to install the compass gem, but for some reason I can't find my ruby dir.  Doubly frustrating because I installed the sass preprossessor gem without any problem, so obviously ruby is installed somewhere, lol.


### Day 4: July 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went back to working on Caesar's Cypher in C  

**Thoughts**: I got it to work using pointers, but I really don't think that is how I should be doing it, so tomorrow I will try to get it working sans pointers.


### Day 5: July 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Struggled with trying to get my Caesar's Cipher to work without using pointers.

**Thoughts**: What's happening is kinda weird. Sometimes it gives me values and sometimes it gives me addresses. I think?...


### Day 6: July 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started 30 days of code challenge and did the first challenge in c and in javascript. Went back over part of the second week lecture from cs50 to see if there is anything that might help me solve Caesar's Cipher without using pointers.

**Thoughts**: Saturday has always been my day off, or as much of a day off as I could make it, so I am going to watch vids and read up on things on my Saturdays, or other relatively easy tasks.


### Day 7: July 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Second day of 30 days of code and I can't figure out how to concat strings in C. But i did solve the rest of the problem.

**Thoughts**: I may decide to drop 30days because the tutorial is for Java and I am trying to do the problems in C. Also I feel like my attention is spread too far with freecodecamp cs50 and 30days.


### Day 8: July 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally!! got the main part of Caesar's Cipher for cs 50 to work.

**Thoughts**: That rush of seeing something work after being stuck for days is some powerful intermittant reinforcer.


### Day 9: July 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did all the little stuff for the Caesar's Cipher problem and rechecked the specification to make sure it was all just so.

**Thoughts**: I'm really learning a lot, but everything takes me so so long. Still every success builds my confidence a bit.


### Day 10: July 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the next exercise for cs50. It's another cypher called Vigenère’s. Worked through something called a segmentation fault.  Struggled with it for quite a while before noticing a flaw in my logic which was easily fixed. 

**Thoughts**: Progress, but so slow. I should probably drop some of my other interests and just concentrate on this one, except I can't stay focused on just one thing for a long time.


### Day 11: July 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on cipher problem for cs50.

**Thoughts**: I just noticed that freecodecamp now has their own version of an introductory programming class.  I've been feeling that my progress is so slow because I am dividing my attention. I am really enjoying the cs50 problems, but I am going to try to concentrate on freecodecamp.


### Day 12: July 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Looked at the next problem for freecodecamp, Search amd Replace. Ended up with a partial solution, but there is some kind of flaw.

**Thoughts**: On first looking at this problemI was clueless, but then it started to come together. I think I should approach programming they way I approach writing. Given a prompt or subject I have no idea what to write, but I trust that my subconscious will come up with something adequate.


### Day 13: July 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Solved search and replace as soon as I glanced over yesterday's code. It was just that I forgot () after the function, lol. Started Pig Latin challenge. After much struggle and reading, conquered regexp.

**Thoughts**: I feel like an imposter. Yes, I seem to be doing better with the challenges, but I still suck so bad at design. The problem isn't that I suck at design, though. The problem is that I have no map for improvement and so I am just avoiding my wikireader.  


### Day 14: July 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working on fcc pig latin challenge.  Got it to work correctly if the word starts with a vowel or one consonant. Tried without success to get it to work if word starts with more than one consonant.

**Thoughts**: Perhaps tomorrow I will try just coding in constant values for words that start with 2 consonants and then, if necessary, 3 in order to detect the underlying pattern I need.


### Day 15: July 31, 2017

**Today's Progress** :I think I am on the cusp of understanding how to make pig Latin challenge work for all cases.

**Thoughts**: I have too many ifs and fors and so on. It's confusing and ugly.  Maybe this is why we have functional programming? Right now I just want to get it working; erhaps then I will go back over functional programming and see if it looks useful. I'm going to start adding 'Plan' to the next day's log when I finish coding. That way I will know exactly where to start.



### Day 16: August 1, 2017

**Plan**: Try to finish pig latin challenge. If time I can start looking at the CSS3 extension gradients section.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the pig Latin challenge. Started looking at chrome css3 gradient extension.  Codepen doesn't like it at all.

**Thoughts**: I don't know if I am getting better at this, or if I have just been hitting a different kind of problem, but this seems easier.  I mean, it still takes me extremely long, but I am not sitting stumped for days.


### Day 17: August 2, 2017

**Plan**: Try to figure out how to do these css3 gradients. If that starts getting too stressful, I can check out the next freecodecamp problem.

**Today's Progress**: Cut and pasted some examples of gradients and then played around with them to try to figure out how they work. 

**Thoughts**: Two hours of experimenting with the code and I still don't really get it. I should probably just abandon the idea of a gradient background. It seems so easy and straight forward, but then it doesn't WAE.


### Day 18: August 3, 2017

**Plan**: Try again to figure out linear gradients.

**Today's Progress**: Finally got the linear gradient to work the way I want.  

**Thoughts**:  I read the directions, do exactly what it says and then it doesn't work.  Then I start changing stuff and fooling around and after a while it usually starts working, but I don't really understand what I am doing.


### Day 19: August 4, 2017

**Plan**: Look around codepen to see how other people deal with having hardly any content. I may look at gradients some more, as sometimes after a break new ideas surface. I also have the option of letting this go and working on the next fcc problem. 

**Today's Progress**: Got a feel for how to deal with limited content on a page by looking through a bunch of codepen projects. Followed a tutorial to make a cool search box for wikipedia viewer project.

**Thoughts**: I'm unhappy with the (lack of) responsiveness of the page. 


### Day 20: August 5, 2017

**Plan**: Saturday is normally my day off, which I use to regroup and give my subconscience a chance to catch up so I am going to try to find something that isn't really hard to do.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on making the wiki viewer responsive. Also spent a good bit of time experimenting with box shadows. 

**Thoughts**: I didn't really make progress on the wiki viewer today, but I feel like I learned a lot, and I have an idea what to try next.


### Day 21: August 6, 2017

**Plan**: Back to bootstrap to refresh my memory and then I can try to apply it to the wiki viewer.

**Today's Progress**: Went back to refresh my memory of bootstrap and then set up some bootstrap columns and adjusted the css for search box and button.

**Thoughts**:  Why does it take so long to fiddle with css? It's like I am never satisfied. Also, I feel like I am not doing this right.


### Day 22: August 7, 2017

**Plan**: More css fussing and work on responsiveness.

**Today's Progress**: Finally got the search box and submit button to look the way I want.

**Thoughts**: I find arranging elements on the page sooooo confusing. I thought bootstrap was supposed to help with that, but sometimes it just doesn't work the way I think it should. WHY is this so hard? I feel like that android Spock and company (OS) drove insane: "ILLOGICAL ILLOGICAL"


### Day 23: August 8, 2017

**Plan**: Continue struggling with the positioning of elements on the page.

**Today's Progress**: Got all the content on the page for the wikipedia viewer and styled it.

**Thoughts**: Just one thing is not responsive. Why? I don't know.


### Day 24: August 9, 2017

**Plan**: Work on responsiveness.

**Today's Progress**: er, now it's worse?

**Thoughts**: I need to learn to save my work before messing with it, because sometimes I forget to do that, and oh what a mess that makes.


### Day 25: August 10, 2017

**Plan**: Try to get things back the way they were by starting a new file and adding the code in a bit at a time so I can find what is causing the problem.

**Today's Progress**: Learned about flex-box and w3-css framework.

**Thoughts**: Neither flex-box nor w3-css would center the form.  Why is centering so hard? Did my coding late in the afternoon and I can see that is not a good time for me to be trying to figure things out.


### Day 26: August 11, 2017

**Plan**: Try flex-box again in case I was just too tired to make it work yesterday.

**Today's Progress**: Nixed flexbox.  Got everything responsive across Chrome, Firefox and Edge.

**Thoughts**: It looks ok, but not exactly as I wanted.  Going to move on because perfect is the enemy of the good. 


### Day 27: August 12, 2017

**Plan**: Not sure what I am going to work on. If I don't think of anything else, I can always start transferring everything to codepen.
That should be good for several aggravating days.

**Today's Progress**:Tried to figure out why my weather api is no longer working. Started trying to figure out how to use wikipedia api.

**Thoughts**: Wow wikipedia api is hard to understand. I think I finally (sort of) get it.  Noticed my random quote machine and local weather pens were messed up.  Fixed the quote machine but can't get the weather api to work. WTF? Transferred the wiki code I have so far to codepen last night with surprisingly little difficulty.


### Day 28: August 13, 2017

**Plan**: Either try to get weather project working again or start constructing code to pull search results from wikipedia. Or both.

**Today's Progress**: Found the problems with the weather app and fixed them.  Wrote down a bunch of notes on jQuery and ajax requests that seem useful for the wikipedia viewer. 

**Thoughts**: I'm still puzzled as to why my weather app stopped working.  Someone suggested I might need a new appi key, but changing that didn't seem to do anything. Anyway I fixed it.


### Day 29: August 14, 2017

**Plan**: Start making Wiki Viewer work.  Get the call to the api worked out.

**Today's Progress**: Got the ajax call to the wikiapp working. Ran into another problem with element positioning. 

**Thoughts**: I feel like I am learning a lot.  I'm almost always going way over my hour minimum because I get absorbed in the work.
 <3 <3 <3 flow
 
 
 ### Day 30: August 15, 2017
 
 **Plan**: See if I can apply the code from the first form to make the 2nd form look the way I originally wanted it.
 
 **Today's Progress**: Struggled with stupid form and its css.  Very little progress made.
 
 **Thoughts**: Did my coding in the evening so I could participate in an online coding group. The group was very nice but I do better if I work in the morning. 
 


  ### Day 31: August 16, 2017
 
  **Plan**: Attack form with renewed vigor.
   
  **Today's Progress**: I have got to stop fiddling with the css for wikipedia viewer or I will die of old age before I finish it. Wasted my day fiddling. MUST STOP.
   
  **Thoughts**:  I was super tempted to skip today because I was all stressed out trying to deal with bureaucracy, but I pushed through. I don't know why I am being so picky about the css. It's not like the javascript code I write isn't baby code, so why should I have learned css thoroughly already? I need to move on.
  
  
 ### Day 32: August 17, 2017
    
  **Plan**:  I will work on functionality. Absolutely no fussing with css. Really.
    
  **Today's Progress**: Worked on functionality for wikipedia viewer. Added instructions on empty search with jQuery. I still have to get the json data onto my page and I am not sure how to do that. But the first button does call the data correctly.
     
  **Thoughts**: Definitely best to work in the morning. I'm smarter and my frustration tolerance is higher. Really enjoying this project.
  
  
 ### Day 33: August 18, 2017
    
 **Plan**: Continue work on random button. Reconsider calling url with js if necessary.
  
 **Today's Progress**: Got distracted by codeschool's free weekend. Checked out several tracks.
   
 **Thoughts**: I seem to be procrastinating.
   
   
  ### Day 34: August 19, 2017
  
 **Plan**: I'm going to allow another day of codeschool so I can check out their sass and flexbox courses, as well as the regular javascript track. Also need to transfer all the new code to codepen so I can post a link to it here.
   
**Today's Progress**:  Worked on Sass and flexbox on code school.

 **Thoughts**: Codeschool is pretty cool, but I think I need to put most of my time into projects.
 
 
 ### Day 35: August 20, 2017
 
 **Plan**: Continue with codeschool courses as this is the last day it is free.
 
 **Today's Progress**: More flexbox and Sass. 
 
  **Thoughts**: I need to get serious and go back to freecodecamp.
  
  
   ### Day 36: August 21, 2017
   
   **Plan**: Back to Wikipedia viewer.
   
   **Today's Progress**: Worked on wikipedia reader. Read about closures.
    
   **Thoughts**: I'm much happier when I am working on fcc stuff, because I truly belief it is the best way to learn. 
   
   
  ### Day 37: August 22, 2017
    
  **Plan**: Work on displaying data from wikipedia. Also can spend some time looking into dot net, but only after some decent work on fcc project.
  
  **Today's Progress**: Sidetracked by wordpress. Ugh. Looked into dot net and C# and felt tired.
  
  **Thoughts**: My energy is too scattered. Not sleeping well. Can't concentrate.  Just want to sleep.
  
  
    ### Day 38: August 23, 2017
    
  **Plan**: Same as yesterday since I didn't get to it: Work on displaying data from wikipedia. 
  
   **Today's Progress**: Got the search working on wikipedia viewer!
   
    **Thoughts**: Working on fcc stuff is more fun the more I learn. I still have a few things I want to do with wiki viewer but the functionality is done.
    
    **Link to project**: https://codepen.io/Gildara/pen/NgXjvo
    
     
  ### Day 39: August 24, 2017
  
 **Plan**: Work on making the rectangles invisible until button is clicked and/or a read more link for each article.
 
  **Today's Progress**:  Very engrossed in project today. Tried many ways to make hidden content visible on click. No success yet.
    
  **Thoughts**: NEED TO SAVE WORK BEFORE I START CHANGING THINGS.  I may be looking for a direct and easy solution when there isn't one.
    Have to sleep on it.
    
 
 ### Day 40: August 25, 2017
   
  **Plan**: Continue trying to make the rectangles do what I want them to do.
  
 **Today's Progress**: Tried a bunch more things but none of them worked.  I have an idea how to simplify the problem though, which I will try tomorrow.
 
**Thoughts**:  NEED TO SAVE WORK BEFORE I START CHANGING THINGS. This project is challenging and frustrating for me  and I really like it.  I have rarely challenged myself in life. Heh, maybe I should be honest and change that rarely to never.


 ### Day 41: August 26, 2017
 
 **Plan**: Make a fresh copy of the project and strip down the page to simplify it so I can figure out what the problem is.
 
 **Today's Progress**: Fixed the problem with the rectangles not displaying the way I wanted them to.
 
 **Thoughts**: Had this weird dream where js/css was floating past me and woke up with a vague sense that I knew how to solve my problem.  Thank you subconscience! What would I do without you?
 
 **Link to Project** https://codepen.io/Gildara/pen/NgXjvo 
 
 
  ### Day 42: August 27, 2017
  
   **Plan**:  Start figuring out read more link.
   
   **Today's Progress**: Worked on read more link for a long time.
   
    **Thoughts**: Very engrossed again. Went way past the hour.  Wish I had more time/energy.
    
    
 ### Day 43: August 28, 2017
    
 **Plan**:  Continue figuring out read more link. Don't forget to add social media links.
 
 **Today's Progress**: Got the read more links where I want them and wae.
 
 **Thoughts**: I got so deeply into a flow state that I forgot to eat and my food got cold.
 
 **Link to Project** https://codepen.io/Gildara/pen/NgXjvo 
 
 
 
 ### Day 44: August 29, 2017
 
 **Plan**:  Try to figure out why entering search terms works correctly but entering nonsense or nothing into search only works once.  Something to do with returns?  Also don't forget about social media links.
 
 **Today's Progress**: Tried many things. Still thinking. Will sleep on it.
 
 **Thoughts**: Decided to forget about social media links. I can do that when I make my portfolio.  I noticed that for wikipedia viewer although the ifs catch the nonsense or enmpty text field and display the right message(once) they never change the rects to display:none. That's odd.
  
  
  
 ### Day 45: August 30, 2017
 
  **Plan**: Keep studying on why entering search terms works correctly but entering nonsense or nothing into search only works once and why the ifs catch the nonsense or empty text field and display the right message(once) but never change the rects to display:none
  
 **Today's Progress**: Worked on learning some css.
  
**Thoughts**: Got distracted by the freecodecamp beta site.  Started working through some of the challenges in the css section and actually learned a few things I didn't know or didn't understand completely. I sure get distracted a lot.
  
  
   ### Day 46: August 31, 2017
   
 **Plan**: Keep working on freecodecamp beta site and/or on wiki viewer.
   
 **Today's Progress**: Worked on wiki viewer but haven't been able to solve the button only works once problem.  Also worked on applied  visual design section of fcc curriculum.
 
 **Thoughts**: It's really aggravating when you see so many people having the same problem you are having, and seeing many solutions which make sense, and trying them all, and nothing works. This button only works once problem is a very common problem, apparently. I may need to ask for help, but i want to see if I can puzzle it out myself first.
 
 
 ### Day 47: Sept. 1, 2017
 
 **Plan**: Applied visual design.
 
  **Today's Progress**: Did some applied visual design challenges and started reading new book on responsive web design.  Also spent a little time on c# and .net.
  
  **Thoughts**: I find visual studio extremely annoying but C# seems kinda interesting.  I'd like to just concentrate on fcc and learning Javascript, but I feel like i should try to learn something about c#njust in case there really is work I can do in that
  language. 
   
   
 ### Day 48: Sept. 2, 2017
  
 **Plan**: Applied visual design challenge and new book on responsive web design.
 
 
 **Today's Progress**: Worked through some more of the applied visual design section of fcc with several forays to other sites to explore the subjects in a little more depth. Read more of Responsive Web Design book.
  
  **Thoughts**: Wow! I had no idea about all these cool things you can do with css3. Fascinating. Can't wait for projects. As regards the responsive web design book, I need to apply what I know about learning and not read stuff I already know.  I do not have to read every page, just quickly go through and find the info that is useful and new to me.
  
  
  ### Day 49: Sept. 3, 2017
  
   **Plan**: Finish applied visual design.  Read more in responsive book or start next section of fcc if there is time.
   
  **Today's Progress**:  Finished applied visual design.
    
   **Thoughts**: Loads of stuff here that is new to me.  
      
      
   ### Day 50: Sept. 4, 2017
   
   **Plan**: Applied accessibility and responsive web design book or C# video tutorial.
   
   
  **Today's Progress**: Started youtube tutorial on C# and dot net, read more about responsive web design, and worked through several challenges from Applied Accessibility section of fcc.
  
   **Thoughts**: It may be better to spread my work between different topics like this so I can stay focused. Keep on keeping on.
   
   
    ### Day 51: Sept. 5, 2017
    
  **Plan**: Applied accessibility and responsive web design book or C# video tutorial.
   
   **Today's Progress**: Finished Applied Accessibility section of fcc.
    
    **Thoughts**: Really enjoying this. Having tried to make a few projects, I can see how useful this stuff is.  Can't wait to start trying all this out. 
    
    
  ### Day 52: Sept. 6, 2017
  
  **Plan**:Do Responsive Web Design Principles on fcc beta. If time can watch more C# and/or read more of responsive web design book.
  
   **Today's Progress**:Finished responsive web design challenges and now ready to start projects.
   
   **Thoughts**: I am intending to redo the ones I have already finished so I can apply some of the stuff I have learned. Going to try to stick to html and css only, since that is all the first section covers. 
   
   
   ### Day 53: Sept. 7, 2017
     
  **Plan**: First up:tribute page! TDD! Exciting!
  
  **Today's Progress**:Started work on tribute page.9/10 tests passing. Really enjoying the TDD.
  https://codepen.io/Gildara/pen/JyqWRz
  
  
  **Thoughts**: Still clueless about design. I think I will go back to applied visual design and see if there is something there that will help me.
  
  
  ### Day 54: Sept. 8, 2017
     
  **Plan**: Place image so last test will pass. Look back over visual design for ideas.
  
  **Today's Progress**:Looked around,picked out, and uploaded some pics for tribute site. tests passing- 10/10.
  
  **Thoughts**: I tried centering my image with flexbox, but even though the image did center, it wouldn't pass the test. Had to use margin:auto. I hope that doesn't mean i can't use flexbox, cause I really wanted to play around with it.
  
  
  ### Day 55: Sept. 9, 2017
     
 **Plan**: Start styling the tribute page and adding content. Remember to back everything up before starting cause I will surely make a godawful mess at first.
 
  **Today's Progress**: Making good progress on tribute page. Learning how little I know.
  
   
  **Thoughts**: So when it comes down to it, I hardly know how to do anything. Lol! As always, real learning will not begin until the brain decides the information is truly needed.
  
 
   ### Day 56: Sept. 10, 2017
   
  **Plan**: Continue with tribute page. Check if tests are still passing on codepen.
  
    **Today's Progress**: Continued working on styling for tribute page. Also spent some time looking at websites.
    
    **Thoughts**: I need to take the time to look closely at a lot of sites if I want to develop some kind of design ability.
    I do believe this can be learned, but it is going to take a lot of work. I don't expect to ever be a great designer, but I believe I can learn to be okay.
    
    
    ### Day 57: Sept. 11, 2017
    
   **Plan**: Keep on keeping on with tribute page.
   
   **Today's Progress**: Started making a todo list with javascript and reviewing some flexbox stuff to use on tribute page.
   
    **Thoughts**: So. Many. Shiny. Things.
    
    
    
    ### Day 58: Sept. 12, 2017
    
   **Plan**: Continue implementing flexbox on tribute page and make first version of todo list. Start second version if time.
   
   **Today's Progress**: More work on to do list and tribute page.
   
    **Thoughts**: I'm never going to be a very good designer, but i am slowly improving, and that progress is all I want.  Still very highly motivated.
    
    
  ### Day 59: Sept. 13, 2017
  
  **Plan**: More to do list and tribute page.
  
    **Today's Progress**: Learned about objects in js and did some styling of tribute page.
    
    **Thoughts**: Very pleased with my tribute page so far.  I know it isn't gorgeous like some people's pages, but it is a big improvement for me. It doesn't look bad!
    
    
  ### Day 60: Sept. 14, 2017
  
  **Plan**: Finish choosing fonts for tribute page and continue working on todo list.
  
  **Today's Progress**: Added toggle to indicate if task has been completed to to do list.  Adding flexbox to tribute page.
  
  **Thoughts**: Learning soooo much. Amazing how much I thought I had learned about flexbox through tutorials. Only now as I am applying it to my tribute page am I starting to learn.
  
  
 ### Day 61: Sept. 15, 2017
 
   **Plan**: Keep styling tribute page and making it responsive.  Continue refactoring javascript todo list code.
   
   **Today's Progress**: More refactoring of todo list code. Struggling today with syntax related to objects. Need more practice.
     
    **Thoughts**: Didn't get to work on tribute page due to time constraints.  But my understanding of js objects is getting better. Progress is progress and I've almost got it. I am here for the process so it doesn't matter how far I get.
    
    
  ### Day 62: Sept. 16, 2017
  
 **Plan**: Repeat work on to do list with objects.
   
  **Today's Progress**: So exhausted today I decided it would be conter productive to try to do anything really hard, so I worked on flexbox tutorial.  It's a very good tutorial and it is clearing up a lot of my flexy confusion.
   
  **Thoughts**: Next round of 100 days of code I am taking every Saturday off as well as allowing myself 10 mental health days whenever I need them.  Keeping this up when so much is going on in my life is really stressful, but I really want to see through this first round with no breaks if i possibly can.
  
 ### Day 63: Sept. 17, 2017
 
 **Plan**: Repeat work on to do list with objects.
 
 **Today's Progress**: Reveiwing and redoing javascript todolist objects, this keyword and closures.
 
 **Thoughts**: I don't know why I am having so much trouble with this. I'll give it one more day and then I will move on.
 
 
  ### Day 64: Sept. 18, 2017
 
 **Plan**: Repeat work on to do list with objects, this keyword and closures.
 
  **Today's Progress**: To do list objects:check.  This keyword:check.  Closures:check. Also worked on links and footer for Tribute Page. 
  
   **Thoughts**: Got a lot done today. Very pleased.
   
   
   
  ### Day 65: Sept. 19, 2017
  
   **Plan**: Continue with to do list project and/or tribute page.
   
   **Today's Progress**: Worked on implementing loops for to do list project and styling for tribute page.
    
   **Thoughts**: I'm tired and hungry. This coding thing is getting to be an obsession. 
   
   
  ### Day 66: Sept. 20, 2017
        
  **Plan**: Continue with to do list project and/or tribute page.
  
  **Today's Progress**: Spent the whole day on css for tribute page.
  
  **Thoughts**: Even with flixbox I am struggling to position items on the page. I guess the next thing will be css grid. 
  whyyyy is this soooo hard?
  
  
 ### Day 67: Sept. 21, 2017
 
 **Plan**: Continue with to do list project and/or tribute page.
 
 **Today's Progress**: Progress? What progress? Worked on responsiveness for tribute page. Tomorrow I am going to pull out the troublesome section and try working on it in isolation.
   
 **Thoughts**: I ask again: why  is layout so fucking hard?
 
 
  ### Day 68: Sept. 22, 2017
  
 **Plan**: Pull out the ul items and work on just that section in isolation and/or loops for to do list project.
   
 **Today's Progress**: Decided to redo tribute page mobile first. Having the same problems I had the other way.  
    
  **Thoughts**: Argh... no one said this would be easy. I wonder what would happen if I put all the elements
  inside one big ol' flexbox?
  
  
 ### Day 69: Sept. 23, 2017
   
 **Plan**: Use flexbox on mobile tribute page and /or work on to do list project.
   
 **Today's Progress**: Started taking a free udacity course on responsive design because I feel like I am now ready for an overview.
    
 **Thoughts**: It's good I am not in any particular hurry.
  
  
 ### Day 70: Sept. 24, 2017
    
 **Plan**: Udacity course for overview of responsive design.
  
 **Today's Progress**: I tried. I'll try some more tomorrow.
   
 **Thoughts**:  Responsive web design is not as easy as I thought it would be.
 
 
  ### Day 71: Sept. 25, 2017
  
  **Plan**: Udacity course for overview of responsive design.
   
  **Today's Progress**: Took notes about responsive design and laid out a detailed plan for starting tribute page mobile first.
    
  **Thoughts**: There's just so much to learn, and I am interested in EVERYTHING.
  
  
 ### Day 72: Sept. 26, 2017
  
 **Plan**: More rwd class and/or start mobile version of tribute page.
 
 **Today's Progress**: Made a lot of progress on mobile tribute site. Just tweeking it now.
  
 **Thoughts**: Mobile first seems to be going better. Also, the practice with flex-box is solidifying my understanding.
    All is well.
    
    
  ### Day 73: Sept. 27, 2017
 
 **Plan**: More work on mobile tribute page.
  
 **Today's Progress**: breakpoints and media queries
  
 **Thoughts**: I waste a lot of time due to perfectionism. It is just so hard for me to skim over things even though I know 
 it is the best way to approach this. I feel like I didn't accomplish a damn thing today. 
 
 
 ### Day 74: Sept. 28, 2017
  
 **Plan**: Get through udacity thing on flexbox and/or work more on mobile version of tribute page.
   
 **Today's Progress**: Finished flexbox thing. Moved on to responsive images.
   
 **Thoughts**: At some point I need to decide I know enough and get on with the page, lol.
  
  
### Day 75: Sept. 29, 2017
 
**Plan**: Continue Udacity responsive images class.
  
**Today's Progress**: Started looking at css grid and did more of Udacity class on responsive images.
   
**Thoughts**: Wish I had more time. I should probably cut down on the number of different things I am trying to do, but they are all so interesting.
  
  
### Day 76: Sept. 30, 2017

**Plan**: More CSS grid and responsive images class.  YDKJS if time. Try to push one of these so I'm not trying to do so many things at once.

**Today's Progress**: Actually ignored plan and worked on Tribute page for fcc.Deeply engrossed. In the flow. Made a lot of progress. 

**Thoughts**: Feeling good.  I don't have to be a great designer, just good enough.  I can compensate by backend strength. Very tired, though.  I might be a lot smarter if I didn't have to get up at 3am to take care of old dog.


### Day 77: Oct. 1, 2017

**Plan**: Continue on tribute page.  Why did media queries stop working???  Maybe it will be obvious after a good night's sleep.

**Today's Progress**: Media queries working again. Having trouble with positioning when the page goes to three columns. It's ok at first, but then it starts looking stupider and stupider.

**Thoughts**: Why is layout so fucking hard? I think my flex containers are not well thought out.  Maybe I will try css grid for next project. I'm super frustrated but strangely not discouraged at all. Time to give it a rest and let the more pwoerful part of my brain chew on it.


### Day 78: Oct. 2, 2017

**Plan**: Continue on tribute page or go back to to do list project. 

**Today's Progress**: Things just don't work quite the way I expect them to. 

**Thoughts**:  Argh. Tired, hungry, and cross. I need a good night's sleep and someone to make me a wholesome meal.


### Day 79: Oct. 3, 2017

**Plan**: Continue on tribute page. Maybe look on codepen for some simple sites to study.

**Today's Progress**: Used actual paper and pen to lay out all the page elements and flex boxes. Started transferring stuff from last attempt into new attempt file, cleaning up the mess as I go.  So far, so good.

**Thoughts**: Seriously, I have learned so much from all the messes I have made. Understanding some of the whys of all this on a deeper level. Invigorating exercise, good night's sleep, and decent food have helped me through my Slough of Despair.   


### Day 80: Oct. 4, 2017

**Plan**: Continue cleaning up and organising tribute page. 

**Today's Progress**: Just cleaning up and organizing html and css for tribute page. 

**Thoughts**: So far, so good. We'll see what happens when I start the media queries again.


### Day 81: Oct. 5, 2017

**Plan**: Start cleaning up breakpoints and media queries.

**Today's Progress**:  Started cleaning up breakpoints and media queries for tribute page.

**Thoughts**: Still can't quite grasp why the itms are so far apart on wider screen. Part of one of the pics is getting cut off and I'm pretty sure if the items would move closer together that wouldn't happen.


### Day 82: Oct. 6, 2017

**Plan**: Continue cleaning up breakpoints and media queries.

**Today's Progress**: Made progress with mobile version through first breakpoint.  

**Thoughts**: For a brief moment there I thought things were actually wae.


### Day 83: Oct. 7, 2017

**Plan**: Continue cleaning up breakpoints and media queries.

**Today's Progress**: Finished tribute page. Two breakpoints, one which changes the layout.  Page is responsive and passes all the tests.  

**Thoughts**: It's no work of art, but I am no artist and I am just a  beginner.

### Day 84: Oct. 8, 2017

**Plan**: Check out next fcc project and/or work on todo list.

**Today's Progress**: Attended freecodecamp meetup. Worked on to do list for a while, but then plunker started doing weird things I did not understand. 

**Thoughts**: I think I probably lost the work I did today because plunker wouldn't save my project.


### Day 85: Oct. 9, 2017

**Plan**: Check out next fcc project and/or work on todo list.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on todo list. Also tried to make anchor tags to different sections of a page. 

**Thoughts**: Anchor tags used to be simple to do, but now I can't get it to work. I feel like an idiot. I hate when there are simple clear directions for doing something but it doesn't work for me.


### Day 86: Oct. 10, 2017

**Plan**: Check out next fcc project and/or work on todo list.

**Today's Progress**: Got my todo list code on plunker straightened out and added a bit to it. Started my survey page but then I decided to think a while and see if I could come up with something more interesting.

**Thoughts**: Still don't know why the anchor tags aren't wae. I even cut and pasted a simple example and I couldn't get that to work.


### Day 87: Oct. 11, 2017

**Plan**: Todo list and/or survey page I guess.

**Today's Progress**: Did some studying of responsive web design now that I see the problem better. Also helped Dean with his projects.
Started working on todo list until I got stuck.

**Thoughts**: Low motivation today. Feel rushed.


### Day 88: Oct. 12, 2017

**Plan**: Todo list and/or study responsive design.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on toggle function for to do list.  Something is wrong with my logic, or maybe it's just a mix up due to all those fors and ifs lolol.

**Thoughts**: Rough day today because I took so long grocery shopping.  Do I want to constrict my freedom this much? 


### Day 89: Oct. 13, 2017

**Plan**: Todo list and/or study responsive design.

**Today's Progress**: Worked on to do list. I see what is going wrong, but I don't see why or how.

**Thoughts**: I'm puzzled. I need to walk away and come back later.


### Day 90: Oct. 14, 2017

**Plan**: Todo list and/or study responsive design.

**Today's Progress**: Finally figured out what was wrong with todo list code. I had a line where I misused this. And, of course, once I saw it, it was obvious and glaring, lol.

**Thoughts**: Having fun again.


### Day 91: Oct. 15, 2017


**Plan**: Todo list and/or study responsive design.

**Today's Progress**: Started user interface for todo list and worked on survey page at fcc meetup.

**Thoughts**: I hope this group gets going. I need other people, and I'm not picky about it, lol. Ok, wait. I am picky. I need people who won't want me to do boring things, i.e.,  anything not related to learning to code. Is that too much to ask?  Also, being old is a definite handicap in this world, so I will have to try hard if I want people.


### Day 92: Oct. 16, 2017

**Plan**: Todo list, study responsive design, work on survey page. Any or all of these are fine.

**Today's Progress**: RWD class all about ways to control font size and started working on ui for to do list.

**Thoughts**: Feeling productive and content.


### Day 93: Oct. 17, 2017

**Plan**: Todo list, study responsive design, learn css grid, work on survey page. Any or all of these are fine.

**Today's Progress**: Put eventListeners on todo list buttons and started form for fcc survey page.

**Link to Project**: https://codepen.io/Gildara/pen/mBLQVP

**Thoughts**: Coding is going well.


### Day 94: Oct. 18, 2017

**Plan**: Todo list, study responsive design, learn css grid, work on survey page. Any or all of these are fine.

**Today's Progress**: Studied fluid measurements and started todo list calling functions with buttons.

**Thoughts**: I actually managed to get the button on the todo list program to call the displaytodos function. Haven't yet figured out how to make one click cycle through all items in the array and print them all to the page, but I still feel accomplished.


### Day 95: Oct. 19, 2017

**Plan**: work on todo list

**Today's Progress**: Practiced using chrome debugger.  Worked on moving display function output to web page. Made progress but not done yet.

**Thoughts**: Really enjoying myself.


### Day 96: Oct. 20, 2017

**Plan**: More todo list.

**Today's Progress**: More practice with debugger. I finally understand step into and step out of. Also did some refactoring of to do list code.

**Thoughts**: Really pleased that I can finally use a debugger to monitor my code. Yay!


### Day 97: Oct. 21, 2017

**Plan**: More todo list.

**Today's Progress**: studied m/v/c thing with "Building Front-End Web Apps with Plain JavaScript".  I feel a need for a bit of an overview just now.

**Thoughts**: 100daysofcode has caused my hobby to feel like an obligation. This is more a probem due to my perfectionism and rigid thinking than it is a problem with 100daysofcode, but I am going to take a break at the end of this round, and if I decide to do another round I will tweak the plan a bit to fall more in line with my ideas about learning and my personality.

   
### Day 98: Oct. 22, 2017

**Plan**: Three more days of 100daysofcode and I have lots of interesting stuff going on. Pick something.

**Today's Progress**: Got a lot of work done on survey page while at #freecodecamp meetup.

**Thoughts**: Why is it so hard to get people to come out and socialize, as well as help each other out with their code problems?  I'm not extremely sociable, but friends are a very good thing to have, doubly so if those friends share your interest in coding.


### Day 99: Oct. 23, 2017

**Plan**: Work on to do list projectand/or buzz through advanced styling class.

**Today's Progress**: 

**Thoughts**:
