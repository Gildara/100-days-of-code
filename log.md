# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0:July 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Will be starting my 100 days on Monday, July 17, 2017.

**Thoughts**: I've hesitated to start this challenge because I believe it is good to take a day off once a week to give my subconscious time to process things.  But it seems like such a great idea I decided to give it a try.


### Day 1: July 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked some more on caesar's Cipher in C.  Finally got argv[1] to cast as an integer.

**Thoughts**:This is much harder than it was in javascript.  I thought the prof said in the lecture(edx cs50 week 2) that you could cast a string as a number just by putting it into a mathematical expression, but I couldn't get it to work. Maybe argv[] is a special case. I ended up c&ping some code I don't completely understand to force argv[n] to be a number.  The code used pointers which haven't even been mentioned yet in class so I suspect I did not do this in the way they wanted.


### Day 2: July 18, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Trying to get a copy of my project on my local machine.  Works fine on codepen, doesn't work from local copy.

**Thoughts**: Most of my time seems to be spent trying to understand tools. Frustrating day.


### Day 3: July 19, 2017

**Today's Progress** Another long, frustrating day, but I did figure out how to process scss files.  

**Thoughts**: I want to install the compass gem, but for some reason I can't find my ruby dir.  Doubly frustrating because I installed the sass preprossessor gem without any problem, so obviously ruby is installed somewhere, lol.


### Day 4: July 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Went back to working on Caesar's Cypher in C  

**Thoughts**: I got it to work using pointers, but I really don't think that is how I should be doing it, so tomorrow I will try to get it working sans pointers.


### Day 5: July 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Struggled with trying to get my Caesar's Cipher to work without using pointers.

**Thoughts**: What's happening is kinda weird. Sometimes it gives me values and sometimes it gives me addresses. I think?...



### Day 6: July 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started 30 days of code challenge and did the first challenge in c and in javascript. Went back over part of the second week lecture from cs50 to see if there is anything that might help me solve Caesar's Cipher without using pointers.

**Thoughts**: Saturday has always been my day off, or as much of a day off as I could make it, so I am going to watch vids and read up on things on my Saturdays, or other relatively easy tasks.


### Day 7: July 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Second day of 30 days of code and I can't figure out how to concat strings in C. But i did solve the rest of the problem.

**Thoughts**: I may decide to drop 30days because the tutorial is for Java and I am trying to do the problems in C. Also I feel like my attention is spread too far with freecodecamp cs50 and 30days.


### Day 8: July 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finally!! got the main part of Caesar's Cipher for cs 50 to work.

**Thoughts**: That rush of seeing something work after being stuck for days is some powerful intermittant reinforcer.


### Day 9: July 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Did all the little stuff for the Caesar's Cipher problem and rechecked the specification to make sure it was all just so.

**Thoughts**: I'm really learning a lot, but everything takes me so so long. Still every success builds my confidence a bit.


### Day 10: July 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started the next exercise for cs50. It's another cypher called Vigenère’s. Worked through something called a segmentation fault.  Struggled with it for quite a while before noticing a flaw in my logic which was easily fixed. 

**Thoughts**: Progress, but so slow. I should probably drop some of my other interests and just concentrate on this one, except I can't stay focused on just one thing for a long time.
